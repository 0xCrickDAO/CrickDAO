# ðŸª™ Token Distribution

The $CRIC token would not be given indiscriminately to anyone who wants it or can buy it.&#x20;

We have come up with a detailed structure to ensure that the power of the $CRIC token is not abused.&#x20;

The smallest proportion of the tokens - 20% - will go to the public in both public and private sales.&#x20;

30% of the total supply of $CRIC tokens would go to the development team, advisory team, partners, and treasury. These funds would be locked in for 2 years with a 5% vesting every month in the release schedule.&#x20;

**Half of the total $CRIC supply (50%) will go to the community.**\


Players will use these tokens to interact with other players, make their fantasy teams, share winnings, make settlements, and a lot more. CrickDAO will pay the community for any work they do through the $CRICutility token.&#x20;

From this 50%, a section will go towards staking and liquidity pool rewards. Through this, the community will be recognizing and compensating for the hard work that community members put into the game.&#x20;

By having a fixed and equitable distribution, we hope to keep the CrickDAO ecosystem free and fair. In the absence of any intermediary, transactions will be much simpler and faster.&#x20;
