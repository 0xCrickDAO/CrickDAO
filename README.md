# üèÜ Introduction

Fantasy sports have been around for a long time, but all of them have one thing in common ‚Äî they are all centralized.&#x20;

What implication does that have on players? Well, you don‚Äôt really own anything. Your winnings are only yours when they reach your bank account. Your in-game purchases are nothing more than digital items that have no use case beyond the game. This gameplay model has too many flaws, so we decided to do something about it.&#x20;

**At CrickDAO, we‚Äôre tokenizing online cricket fantasy sports and allowing users to truly own their in-game assets in the form of NFTs and cryptocurrencies.**&#x20;

That changes everything about the existing centralized fantasy game models. Your assets are no longer the gaming companies‚Äô.&#x20;

We have put the power back at the hands of the people. Here‚Äôs how.&#x20;

NFTs open the door to the metaverse for everyone. You can trade them both inside and outside the game for _real money_.&#x20;

Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, generate an in-game economy that is both open and self-sustaining.&#x20;

_We welcome you to the world of CrickDAO where fantasy sports get a new meaning. Join us as we enter the next generation of fantasy gaming._&#x20;
