# ðŸ”® Fantasy Sport

Fantasy Cricket is a strategy-based online sports game where you have to create a virtual team of real cricketers who are competing in real tournaments across the world. You gain points based on how well these players perform in the actual matches and how closely you predict the same.&#x20;

All fantasy sports tournaments around the world operate in the same model.&#x20;

If you are an Indian cricket fan, you must have come across or heard of apps like MPL and Dream 11. These are currently the most popular in India, where players can form and alter their teams before every match.&#x20;

Some of these games also give cash rewards. ****&#x20;

Users bet against or for specific teams or players. The closer the results are to your prediction, the bigger your reward.&#x20;

However, _**you risk losing your money at the same time. Wrong predictions mean you lose all or most of your money.**_&#x20;
